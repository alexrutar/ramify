Inverted mode:
- also print the vertex last (on top of reversing the order)
- new `WriteRow` trait, implemented for any `io::Write`
- remove the inverted thing from the trait and put it into the config instead

Add a new `Columns` data structure:
- basic operations on 'blocks': align, fork, fork_prepare
- should internally hold an `&mut [(V, usize)]`

Better basic operations
- basic operations like writing vertex row, preparing vertex row, write padding row, etc
  be abstracted as 'internal' methods? maybe if they are clean enough they can become
  external methods




Documentation:

- introduce basic terminology; vertex; children; parent
- idea of 'active' vertices (vertices not yet drawn for which the parent has already been
  drawn)
- idea of the 'state' being intermediate between two rows
- predictive rendering and preparation for following vertices
- delayed branching (if there is padding)
- width limitations (how it relates to slack, and a minimum slack parameter)
- the algorithm used to compute how much width is required
- explain how width interacts with the annotation (we need to make space, so the tree does not
  overlap with the annotation in subsequent rows)
- one step lookahead, but not more
- 2-way vs 3-way forks; child order
- annotation layout, make 'box limit' diagrams showing where the various margins are, etc.
- internal data model, i.e. a sorted vec of columns with vertices
- description of the fundamental components of the algorithm (basically, operations which
  attempt to move a given column to a new location, plus 'forks', and unmoveable markers)
- whitespace management; no trailing whitespace; buffered whitespace (explain how this relates
  to [`WriteBranch`]).
- children/annotation having mutable self-reference, but none of the other methods; call order
  rules

### Internal state
The generator corresponds to the state at the `tip` of a partially written branch diagram. In
order to reduce the width of the branch diagram, multiple vertices can share the same edges
within the diagram.

For example, consider the following partial branch diagram. The vertex `0` is the root.

We can see that it has children `3`, `1`, and `2`. The vertex `2` also has a child `4`. These
vertices also have an unknown number of children that have not yet been drawn, corresponding to the
outgoing edges at the bottom of the diagram.
